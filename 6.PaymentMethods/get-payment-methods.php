/**
 * Get Payment Methods
 *
 * Optionally the payment method selection page can be skipped, so the shopper 
 * starts directly on the payment details entry page. This is done by calling 
 * details.shtml instead of select.shtml. A further parameter, brandCode, 
 * should be supplied with the payment method chosen (see Payment Methods section 
 * for more details, but note that the group values are not valid). 
 * 
 * The directory service can also be used to request which payment methods 
 * are available for the shopper on your specific merchant account. 
 * This is done by calling directory.shtml with a normal payment request. 
 * This file provides a code example showing how to retreive the 
 * payment methods enabled for the specified merchant account. 
 * 
 * Please note that the countryCode field is mandatory to receive 
 * back the correct payment methods.
