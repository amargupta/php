/**
 * Receive notifcations from Adyen using HTTP Post
 * 
 * Whenever a payment is made, a modification is processed or a report is
 * available we will notify you. The notifications tell you for instance if
 * an authorisation was performed successfully. 
 * Notifications should be used to keep your backoffice systems up to date with
 * the status of each payment and modification. Notifications are sent 
 * using a SOAP call or using HTTP POST to a server of your choice. 
 * This file describes how HTTP Post notifcations can be received in PHP.

 * Security:
 * We recommend you to secure your notification server. You can secure it
 * using a username/password which can be configured in the CA. The username
 * and password will be available in the request in: $_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER'] and 
 * $_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_PW']. Alternatively, is to allow only traffic that
 * comes from Adyen servers.
