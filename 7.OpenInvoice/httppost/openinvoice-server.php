/**
 * Open Invoice Server using HTTP Post
 * 
 * Open Invoice lowers the barrier substantially for shoppers to buy products on a 
 * merchant's website. By providing their personal data, like address and date of birth, 
 * an assessment is made if we allow the shopper to receive the product before the payment 
 * is made. The invoice is shipped along with the product. When the invoice is not paid and 
 * the goods are not returned the merchant has the option to turn the invoice over to a 
 * debt collection agency. 
 *
 * Please note that the Open Invoice paymentmethod is available in a limited number 
 * of countries and not enabled by default. If you like to enable it, please contact Adyen Support.
 *
 * How does the Open Invoice process works?
 * 1. A payment is created by sending in delivery- and billing address. See 1.HPP/create-payment-on-hpp-advanced.php
 *    on how to provide that in advance. Adyen sends a request to your Open Invoice service to 
 *    retrieve the order lines associated with the payment. 
 * 2. The merchant's Open Invoice server returns the order lines;
 * 3. Adyen receives the order lines and once the shopper passes the risk checks, the payment will be Authorised.
 * 4. The merchant send the goods to the shopper and Captures the payment, by sending a regular capture
 *    request, see 4.Modifications/httppost/capture.php on how to do that.
 * 5. Adyen sends another request to the open invoice service to request the order lines; 
 * 
 * Please note: using our API requires a web service user. Set up your Webservice 
 * user: Adyen Test CA >> Settings >> Users >> ws@Company. >> Generate Password >> Submit

/**
 * $_POST
 * The variable $_POST will contain the following key/values:
 * $_POST[openInvoiceDetailRequest_amount_currency]: Currency of the payment
 * $_POST[openInvoiceDetailRequest_amount_value]: the value in minor units so EUR 1,00 = 100
 * $_POST[openInvoiceDetailRequest_merchantAccount]: The merchant account the payment was processed with;
 * $_POST[openInvoiceDetailRequest_reference]: The merchant reference of the payment, which should be used to
 * find the order in your system. 
 *
 * Implementation of the action retrieveDetail which will be called by Adyen. 
 * The action retrieveDetail will be called by Adyen in the following scenarios:
 * 1. Authorisation: When the initial payment is created Adyen will request the order lines.
 * 2. Capture: When the payment is captured Adyen will request the order lines, it is possible
 *    to capture less money than the initial payment.
 * 3. Refund: If the money is already collected but the shopper should be credited the refund 
 *    option refunds (part of) the transaction amount. If the money is already collected but the 
 *    shopper should be credited the refund option refunds (part of) the transaction amount.
